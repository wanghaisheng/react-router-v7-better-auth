## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/foxlau/react-router-v7-better-auth.git
npm install
```

### Development

Run an initial database migration:

```bash
npm run db:apply
```

If you modify the Drizzle ORM schema, please run `npm run db:generate` first. If you need to delete the generated SQL migrations, execute `npm run db:drop` and select the SQL migration you wish to remove.

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

Deployment is done using the Wrangler CLI.

Use the following commands to create the D1 database and KV cache for better authentication sessions. Remember to replace the `db` and `kv` configurations in the `wrangler.toml` file with the data generated by these commands:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 create rr7-better-auth
npx wrangler kv namespace create AUTH_CACHE_KV
```

To deploy directly to production:

```sh
npm run db:apply-prod
npm run deploy
```

To deploy a preview URL:

```sh
npm run deploy:version
```

You can then promote a version to production after verification or roll it out progressively.

```sh
npm run deploy:promote
```
